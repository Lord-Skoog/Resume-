## Projects: 
-  Morse Code - https://github.com/Lord-Skoog/morse_code
	- The goal of this project was to learn how to code using GPIO inputs and Code GPIO outputs. 
	- This would come in handy later down the line, as I was able to make a lot of fun things using GPIO related tech.
- Final Project - https://github.com/Lord-Skoog/Raspberry-pi-Clock
	 - The purpose of this project was to put a clock in an area of the building that students could see whilst on break for 10 minutes. Included was an alarm function to signal when a break was over. 
	- I learned a lot about how to use pygame, and how generating graphics using python worked.
